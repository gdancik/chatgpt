# Example ChatGPT prompts

These are just some ideas to demonstrate the variety of ways ChatGPT and other large language models can be used. A key part to using these tools successfully is to be able to develop prompts that generate the desired result (a process known as *prompt engineering*). I encourage you to play around with your own prompts, as well as ask follow-up questions.

A good guide for writing effective prompts can be found at https://writesonic.com/blog/chatgpt-prompts. 

Note that within a thread, ChatGPT's response will be based on roughly the last 3000 words of the conversation. In order to avoid this, you can start a new chat.

### A prompt for factual information

```
What is the capital of Hartford?
```

### A prompt for ideas

```
Please generate 5 ideas for essays related to the future use of artificial intelligence.
```

### A prompt for an outline

```

```

### A prompt to correct text

```
Correct the error in the following statement: 1 + 1 = 3
```

### A prompt to fix typos or grammatical errors

Example where there are errors:

```
Rewrite the following sentence without any grammatical errors. jill and her brother tim who was wearing a red hat, went to the store last tuesday.
```

Example where there are no errors:

```
Rewrite the following sentence without any grammatical errors. Eastern Connecticut State University, located in Willimantic, CT, was founded in 1889.
```

In my case, ChatGPT re-wrote the above sentence even though there are no errors. Below is an alternative prompt.

```
Rewrite the following sentence without any grammatical errors. If there are no errors, say so. The sentence is: Eastern Connecticut State University, located in Willimantic, CT, was founded in 1889.
```

### A prompt that uses ChatGPT as a tutor

```
Please explain what each of the following lines from Rome and Juliet mean:

O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name,
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
And Iâ€™ll no longer be a Capulet.
```


### A prompt to generate assignments

```
Please create a multiple-choice question about Abraham Lincoln's life. There should be 4 possible answers and only 1 correct one. Specify the correct answer.
